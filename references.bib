  abstract = {Applications structured as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks occur in many domains, including popular scientific workflows. DAG scheduling has thus received an enormous amount of attention. Many of the popular DAG scheduling heuristics make scheduling decisions based on path lengths. At large scale compute platforms are subject to various types of failures with non-negligible probabilities of occurrence. Failures that have recently received increased attention are “silent errors,” which cause data corruption. Tolerating silent errors is done by checking the validity of computed results and possibly re-executing a task from scratch. The execution time of a task then becomes a random variable, and so do path lengths in a DAG. Unfortunately, computing the expected makespan of a DAG (and equivalently computing expected path lengths in a DAG) is a computationally difficult problem. Consequently, designing effective scheduling heuristics in this context is challenging. In this work, we propose an algorithm that computes a first order approximation of the expected makespan of a DAG when tasks are subject to silent errors. We find that our proposed approximation outperforms previously proposed approaches both in terms of approximation error and of speed.}

  abstract = {We consider a variant of the well-known, NP-complete problem of minimum cut linear arrangement for directed acyclic graphs. In this variant, we are given a directed acyclic graph and we are asked to find a topological ordering such that the maximum number of cut edges at any point in this ordering is minimum. In our variant, the vertices and edges have weights, and the aim is to minimize the maximum weight of cut edges in addition to the weight of the last vertex before the cut. There is a known, polynomial time algorithm (Liu, 1987 [17]) for the cases where the input graph is a rooted tree. We focus on the instances where the input graph is a directed series-parallel graph, and propose a polynomial time algorithm, thus expanding the class of graphs for which a polynomial time algorithm is known. Directed acyclic graphs are used to model scientific applications where the vertices correspond to the tasks of a given application and the edges represent the dependencies between the tasks. In such models, the problem we address reads as minimizing the peak memory requirement in an execution of the application. Our work, combined with Liu's work on rooted trees addresses this practical problem in two important classes of applications.}
